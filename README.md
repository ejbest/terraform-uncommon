2. for each of my domains - see list below - would like to account for tracker db
3. would like to setup the email TX and how "email" will be handled
4. considering zoho (already have) or hubspot (perhaps or some other cheap or free) send email solution
5. want to have complete code / terraform solution for email sending and DMARC / SPF / TXT
6. Have a cloudflare dns module and repo

Here is the DNS repo that I have

- Each is in a seperate account for free usage of Cloudflare 
- Each has a current working token my vault.waterskiingguy.com
